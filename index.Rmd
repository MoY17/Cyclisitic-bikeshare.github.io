## **Ask**

This phase of the data process is about identifying the problems which are relevant to the stakeholders. These challenges shall be the guide in carrying out each of the steps of the data processing.<br>

### Background

This case study is one of the optional projects of track 1 of the "Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study". The course is the last part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. This case study was described to be similar to case studies conducted on job interviews. The business task, data set and collections of identified deliverable are specified by the course and must be presented to expected stakeholders. Once done with the case study, it can be included in the portfolio to demonstrate data analytics related skills for future job interviews.
  
In the process of doing this case study, real-world tasks of a junior data analyst shall be completed. In answering key business questions for the devised company Cyclistic, the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act shall be followed.<br>

### Scenario

I am part of the marketing analyst team of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, as a junior data analyst. The director, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual memberships is relevant in the eventual success of the company. The finance analysts inferred that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
  
The bike-share program of Cyclistic features more than 5800 bicycles and 600 dock stations as well as assistive bikes like reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes. About 8% of the riders utilizes the assistive bikes. Majority of the bikers use bikes for recreation and fun and about 30% use bikes for commuting.
  
The Cyclistic executive team shall determine the suitability of the recommended marketing program.<br>

### Business use case

Guide questions for the business task:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? (The question asked by Moreno)

**Business task**
  Formulate top 3 recommendations on how casual riders may upgrade to annual membership by understanding their differences from the result of the analysis of the historical data.<br>

## **Data preparation**

The data source provides monthly data of users with the latest data dating to November of 2022.<br>

### Setting up environment

```{r environment}
library(tidyverse) #For cleaning data
library(dplyr) #Data manipulation
library(skimr) #Data summary
library(lubridate) #Date manipulation
library(ggpattern) #for fill pattern
library(RColorBrewer) #Color palettes
library(rmarkdown) #documentation
```

<br>Data from the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data shall be used. The data sets that will be included in the data analysis process are the trip data from January 1, 2021 up to November 30, 2022, 12 months in total. The data is imported to Rstudio:

```{r data import, message=FALSE}
tripdata_202112 <- read_csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Dec, 2021
tripdata_202201 <- read_csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Jan, 2022
tripdata_202202 <- read_csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Feb, 2022
tripdata_202203 <- read_csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Mar, 2022
tripdata_202204 <- read_csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Apr, 2022
tripdata_202205 <- read_csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv") #May, 2022
tripdata_202206 <- read_csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Jun, 2022
tripdata_202207 <- read_csv("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Jul, 2022
tripdata_202208 <- read_csv("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Aug, 2022
tripdata_202209 <- read_csv("202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv") #Sep, 2022
tripdata_202210 <- read_csv("202210-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Oct, 2022
tripdata_202211 <- read_csv("202211-divvy-tripdata.csv") #Nov, 2022
```

<br>The data types are compared and checked. Each have similar structures:
 * ride_id as character
 * rideable_type as character
 * started_at as datetime
 * ended_at as datetime
 * start_station_name as character
 * start_station_id as character
 * end_station_name as character
 * end_station_id as character
 * start_lat as numeric
 * start_lng as numeric
 * end_lat as numeric
 * end_lng as numeric
 * member_casual as character

To explore and analyze the data as a whole, the 12 data sets should be joined.<br>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tripdata_all <- tripdata_202112 %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202201) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202202) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202203) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202204) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202205) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202206) %>% 
  full_join(tripdata_202207) %>%
  full_join(tripdata_202208) %>%
  full_join(tripdata_202209) %>%
  full_join(tripdata_202210) %>%
  full_join(tripdata_202211)
```

<br>This results in a data frame, `tripdata_all`, with 5733451 rows, excluding the header column, and 13 columns. Then, the csv file is exported in order to have a copy of the raw data in the computer.

```{r trip data export, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
tripdata_all <- read_csv("tripdata_all.csv")
```


```{r}
nrow(tripdata_all) == n_unique(tripdata_all$ride_id)
```

The number of rows of `tripdata_all` is also equal to the number of unique values of `tripdata_all$ride_id` hence, it is the primary key.<br>

## **Data processing**

The summary statistics is shown below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
skim_without_charts(tripdata_all)
```

<br>

### Conversion of categorical columns as factors

The `rideable_type` has 3 unique values namely as `electric_bike`, `classic_bike` and `docked_bike`. The `member_casual` has 2 unique values `member`, for users with annual subscription, and `casual`, for users who avail single-ride pass or full-day pass. The variables `rideable_type` and `member_casual` are converted as factors for better analysis using `ggplot2` using these variables.

```{r}
tripdata_all2 <- tripdata_all #Creating an alternative data frame for the conversion of data types
tripdata_all2$rideable_type <- as.factor(tripdata_all2$rideable_type)
tripdata_all2$member_casual <- as.factor(tripdata_all2$member_casual)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
#Checking for levels of factors
levels(tripdata_all2$rideable_type)
levels(tripdata_all2$member_casual)
```

<br>

### Cleaning of rows with missing values

Rows were checked for missing values of station names and station ids.

```{r}
#Checking for rows with `NA` values
##start station name has a value and start station id is missing
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(start_station_name)&is.na(start_station_id))

##start station name is missing and start station id has a value
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(is.na(start_station_name)&!is.na(start_station_id))

##end station name has a value and end station id is missing
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(end_station_name)&is.na(end_station_id))

##end station name is missing and end station id has a value
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(is.na(end_station_name)&!is.na(end_station_id))

```

<br>There are no rows with a value on station name and a missing value on the station id and there are no rows with a value on station id and a missing value on the station name hence, missing values on station names and station ids appear simultaneously.

```{r}
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(is.na(end_lat)&!is.na(end_lng))
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(end_lat)&is.na(end_lng))

```

<br>Missing values on end latitude and longitude appear simultaneously as well. 

### Unique count of latitudes and longitudes per station names

Unique count of grid coordinates for start station names:

```{r for start station names}
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(count_unique_lat = n_unique(start_lat), count_unique_lng = n_unique(start_lng)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_unique_lat))
```

Unique count of grid coordinates for end station names:

```{r for end station names}
tripdata_all2 %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(count_unique_lat = n_unique(end_lat), count_unique_lng = n_unique(end_lng)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_unique_lat))
```

<br>As the count of unique grid coordinates per station names is large, these rows of station names with missing values shall be deleted as a more comprehensive way of data analysis is needed in filling these values.

```{r}
trip_clean1 <- drop_na(tripdata_all2)
```

<br>Rows with missing values are deleted. The summary of the cleaned data set is shown:

```{r echo=FALSE}
skim_without_charts(trip_clean1)
```

<br>

### Checking of station names and ids

The unique start station names and start station ids were examined. A data frame showing the count of each unique ids of the station names is shown below:

```{r}
dataframe1 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  select(start_station_name, start_station_id) %>%
  group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(ss_id_count = n_unique(start_station_id)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ss_id_count))

dataframe1.1 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  filter(n_unique(start_station_id)==2) %>% 
  summarise(start_station_id = unique(start_station_id))

dataframe1.2 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  select(start_station_name, start_station_id) %>% 
  count(start_station_name, start_station_id)
```
```{r}
dataframe1.3 <- inner_join(dataframe1.1, dataframe1.2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n), .by_group = TRUE)
head(dataframe1.3)
```

There are 17 station names with two station ids and the difference on the count of station ids for each unique station names is large.<br>

```{r}
dataframe2 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  select(start_station_id, start_station_name) %>%
  group_by(start_station_id) %>% 
  summarise(ss_name_count = n_unique(start_station_name)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ss_name_count))

dataframe2.1 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  group_by(start_station_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_unique(start_station_name))) %>% 
  filter(n_unique(start_station_name)!=1) %>%
  summarise(start_station_name = unique(start_station_name))

dataframe2.2 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  select(start_station_id, start_station_name) %>% 
  count(start_station_id, start_station_name)

dataframe2.3 <- inner_join(dataframe2.1, dataframe2.2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n), .by_group = TRUE)
```

<br>The greatest count of unique station names is 3 which is the case for the station id `514`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
dataframe2.3[93:95,]
```

There are also station ids with counts of unique stations names of less than 3.

Some start station ids with multiple station names contains station names that are similar, e.g.:

```{r echo=FALSE}
dataframe2.3[41:50,]
```

<br>Some start station ids have misspellings on their station names resulting in multiple counts of unique start station names.

```{r echo=FALSE}
dataframe2.3[1:4,]
```

<br>It is decided to use station ids as the identification for the stations. The table below shows the new start station ids for each start station names with two unique start station ids. The start station ids with the higher count was used. The new ids for each start station names with two station ids is shown below:

```{r}
dataframe1.4 <- data.frame(dataframe1.3[seq(1,34,by=2),1:2])

dataframe1.5 <- trip_clean1 %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  filter(n_unique(start_station_id)==1) %>% 
  summarise(start_station_id = unique(start_station_id))

dataframe1.6 <- full_join(dataframe1.4, dataframe1.5)
start_station_names_ids <- dataframe1.6
```

The data set is cleaned with the new start station ids. The first 6 rows of the new data set is shown: 

```{r cleaning start_station_name_id}
trip_clean2 <- left_join(trip_clean1, start_station_names_ids, by = "start_station_name", suffix = c(".x",""))
trip_clean2 <- trip_clean2 %>% 
  select(1:5,14,7:13)
head(trip_clean2)
```

<br>Next, the same data cleaning process is applied with the end station names and ids. The table of the end station names with two unique ids and their count is shown:

```{r}
dataframe3 <- trip_clean2 %>% 
  select(end_station_name, end_station_id) %>%
  group_by(end_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(es_id_count = n_unique(end_station_id)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(es_id_count))

dataframe3.1 <- trip_clean2 %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name) %>% 
  filter(n_unique(end_station_id)==2) %>% 
  summarise(end_station_id = unique(end_station_id))

dataframe3.2 <- trip_clean2 %>% 
  select(end_station_name, end_station_id) %>% 
  count(end_station_name, end_station_id)

dataframe3.3 <- inner_join(dataframe3.1, dataframe3.2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n), .by_group = TRUE)
dataframe3.3
```

<br>The table below shows the new end station ids for each end station names with two unique end station ids. The end station ids with the higher count was used similar with the first process. The new ids for each end station names with two station ids is shown below:

```{r}
dataframe3.4 <- data.frame(dataframe3.3[seq(1,32,by=2),1:2])

dataframe3.5 <- trip_clean2 %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name) %>% 
  filter(n_unique(end_station_id)==1) %>% 
  summarise(end_station_id = unique(end_station_id))

dataframe3.6 <- full_join(dataframe3.4, dataframe3.5)
end_station_names_ids <- dataframe3.6
```

<br>The data set is cleaned with the new end station ids. The first 6 rows of the new data set is shown: 

```{r cleaning end_station_name_id}
trip_clean3 <- left_join(trip_clean2, end_station_names_ids, by = "end_station_name", suffix = c(".x",""))
trip_clean3 <- trip_clean3 %>% 
  select(1:7,14,9:13)
head(trip_clean3)
```

<br>The columns containing station ids are converted to factors. The station  names columns are removed, the station ids columns shall be used in grouping by location.

```{r}
##Conversion of station id columns to factors
trip_clean3$start_station_id  <- as.factor(trip_clean3$start_station_id)
trip_clean3$end_station_id  <- as.factor(trip_clean3$end_station_id)

##Removal of the station name columns
trip_clean4 <- trip_clean3 %>% 
  select(1:4,6,8:13)
head(trip_clean4)
```

<br>

### Cleaning of the grid coordinate columns

A scatter plot is made with the `start_lat` as the horizontal values and `start_lng` as the vertical values.

```{r}
scatterplot1 <- ggplot(trip_clean4, aes(x=start_lat, y=start_lng))+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4)
scatterplot1
```

The points are cluttered between $41.5^{\circ}$ and $42.5^{\circ}$ latitude and an outlier is at `start_lat>45`.

Another scatter plot is made with the `end_lat` as the horizontal values and `end_lng` as the vertical values. The same with the first scatterplot, outliers are identified where `end_lat` and `end_lng` are both zero.<br>

```{r}
scatterplot2 <- ggplot(trip_clean4, aes(x=end_lat, y=end_lng))+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4)
scatterplot2
```

The [border coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:Location_map/data/United_States_Chicago) of Chicago for latitudes are $41.9653^{\circ}$(top) and $41.8096^{\circ}$(bottom) and for longitudes $-87.7738^{\circ}$(left) and $-87.5658^{\circ}$(right). These outliers are removed, 9 rows are deleted.

```{r}
trip_clean5 <- trip_clean4 %>% 
  filter(end_lat!=0) %>% 
  filter(between(start_lat, 41.5, 42.5))
head(trip_clean5)
```

### Addition of two new variables day and month

The initial time of ride, represented by the variable `started_at`, and the final time of ride, represented by the variable `ended_at`, are POSIXct date times. A new variable is added which measures the duration of a trip. It is the difference between `ended_at` and `started_at`. Negative duration were discarded, 69 rows are deleted.

```{r}
trip_new1 <- trip_clean5 %>% 
  mutate(ride_length = int_length(interval(started_at, ended_at)),
         .after = ended_at) %>% 
  filter(ride_length >= 0)
head(trip_new1)
```

<br>Two columns are added which are the day and month of the starting datetime of a ride. The new columns are ordered factor data types.

```{r}
trip_data <- trip_new1 %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),
         month_of_year = month(started_at, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
head(trip_data)
```

<br>After processing and cleaning the raw data, a summary for the cleaned data set is shown:

```{r}
skim_without_charts(trip_data)
```

##  **Data analysis**

### Statistical summary based on membership type

The mean, median, minimum and maximum ride length of the data based on membership type is presented.

```{r}
trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(ride_length), median = median(ride_length),
          min = min(ride_length), max = max(ride_length))
```

The mean and median of the length of ride is greater for casual riders. The maximum time of ride is also greater for casual riders. It can be concluded that riders that have annual membership spent lesser time per ride. Annual member rides are bounded by time restrictions as a reason for their shorter length of ride. Casual riders have more free time, their rides are spent in a leisurely manner.<br>

```{r first theme, include=FALSE}
theme1 <- theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "#2B1703"),
                legend.direction = "vertical",
                legend.position = "right",
                legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#595959", linetype = "solid", linewidth = 1.4, color = "gray0"),
                legend.text = element_text(color = "#F0F0F0", size = 7),
                legend.title = element_text(color = "#F0F0F0", size = 9),
                legend.box.spacing = unit(12.5, "pt"),
                legend.justification = c(1,1),
                legend.key.size = unit(15, "pt"),
                plot.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"),
                panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#BFBFBF",linetype = "solid", linewidth = 1.5, color = "gray0"),
                panel.spacing = unit(10,"pt"),
                plot.margin = margin(t=17.5, r=17.5, b=17.5, l=17.5, unit="pt"),
                plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 17.5)
)
```

<br>

### Number of rides per member type

```{r barplot 1, opts.label="barplot"}
ggplot(trip_data, aes(x = member_casual, fill = rideable_type))+
  geom_bar(width = 0.8)+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual",
                    palette = "Set2",
                    labels = c("classic", "docked", "electric"))+
  labs(title = "Number of rides per membership type",
       subtitle = "partitioned by bike types",
       x = "Membership type",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "bike types",
       caption = "Data from Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC"
       )+
  theme1+
  annotate("text", x = 2,
           y = 3000000,
           label = "no docked bike rides",
           size = 4)+
  annotate("segment", xend = 1.05,
           yend =1500000,
           x = 1.8,
           y = 2870000,
           linewidth = 0.9,
           color = "#595959",
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, "pt"), type = "closed")
  )
```

From December of 2021 up to November of 2022, there are lesser casual rides. The number of electric and classic bike use for casual riders do not differ greatly but noticeably, there are more classic bike rides for annual members. There are no <span style="color: #fc8d62;">docked bike</span> usage for annual members. Classic bike use for annual members can be prioritized mainly and next is electric bike use.<br>

```{r second theme, include=FALSE}
theme2 <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, margin = margin(t=14, r=10, b=0, l=0, unit="pt")),
                legend.key = element_rect(linewidth = 1, linetype = "solid", color = "#F0F0F0")
                )
```

### Mean ride duration each day

```{r barplot 2, opts.label="barplot"}
trip_data_summ1 <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ride_length = mean(ride_length))

ggplot(trip_data_summ1, aes(x = day_of_week, y = mean_ride_length, fill = mean_ride_length, pattern = member_casual))+
  geom_col_pattern(position = "dodge", pattern_density =0.3)+
  scale_fill_distiller(type = "seq", palette = "PuBu")+
  labs(title = "Mean ride duration by day",
       subtitle = "measured in seconds",
       x = "Day of the week",
       y = "Ride length",
       fill = "mean ride time",
       pattern = "membership type",
       caption = "Data from Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC"
  )+
  theme1+
  theme2
```

For any day of the week, the mean ride time for casual riders is always greater than annual members. There is an increase in ride time on Sunday and Saturday both for casual and member ridership but only a slight change for annual members. Ride time in a day increases and reaches its peak as the weekend approaches. Annual members ride time per day do not vary widely, this is an indicator that they use Cyclistic bikes steadily in a week.<br>

### Mean number of rider each day

```{r barplot 3, opts.label="barplot"}
trip_data_summ2 <- trip_data %>% 
  mutate(day_date_fac = as.factor(date(started_at))) %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(mean_count = n()/n_distinct(day_date_fac))

ggplot(trip_data_summ2, aes(x = day_of_week, y = mean_count, fill = mean_count, pattern = member_casual))+
  geom_col_pattern(position = "dodge", pattern_density =0.3)+
  scale_fill_distiller(type = "seq", palette = "OrRd", direction = 1)+
  labs(title = "Mean count of rides by day",
       x = "Day of the week",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "mean count",
       pattern = "membership type",
       caption = "Data from Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC"
  )+
  theme2+
  theme1
```

The average count of rides is significantly higher for riders with annual memberships on weekdays when compared with the average count of rides for casual riders. As the average count of rides for members decreases on weekends while increases for casual riders, the difference in average count of rides on weekends is not huge. For casual rides, the trend is similar with its trend on mean ride duration. There is a higher count of casual rides on weekends.<br>

### Total number of rides each month

```{r barplot 4, opts.label="barplot"}
trip_data_summ4 <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(month_of_year, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(count_by_m = n())

ggplot(trip_data_summ4, aes(x = month_of_year, y = count_by_m, fill = count_by_m, pattern = member_casual))+

For both casual and member rides, the count of rides are highest on the months of May up to September. The lowest number of rides for both membership types are on the months of January, February and December. The counts of rides for members and casual riders have similar <span style="color: blue;">trends</span>.<br>

### Data analysis based on initial and final ride locations

#### Data aggregation for Tableau

The data set is aggregated showing counts of ride by path taken(from initial station id to final station id), it is also grouped by membership type.

```{r}
trip_data_agg <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(id_count = n(),
            initial_lat = mean(start_lat),
            initial_lng = mean(start_lng),
            final_lat = mean(end_lat),
            final_lng = mean(end_lng))
head(trip_data_agg)
```

##### **Density map for the overall data**

```{r overall density map}
include_graphics("density_map_all.png")
```

For the data including both annual members and casual riders, the start station ids are concentrated about the center of the town.<br>

##### **Density map for annual members**

```{r}
include_graphics("density_map_member.png")
```

For the data including annual members only, the start station ids are also concentrated about the center of the town.<br>

##### **Density map for casual riders**

```{r casual density map}
include_graphics("density_map_casual.png")
```

For the data including casual riders only, the same pattern can be observed.<br>

##### **Top routes for annual members**

```{r top member routes}
include_graphics("routes_member.png")
```

Notice that routes with the highest count of rides are scattered around the town.<br>

##### **Top routes for casual riders**

```{r top casual rider routes}
include_graphics("routes_casual.png")
```

Notice that routes of casual riders are dense about the center of the town which is the same pattern as the volume of rides for casual riders.<br>

## **Recommendations**

Based on the results of the data analysis here are the top recommendations on how casual riders would be encouraged to avail the annual subscription:

1. Riders with **annual memberships** tend to use bikes for **commuting** as described by the low ride time for them while casual tend to use the bikes for a longer period of time for leisurely manner. The greater volume of riders with annual membership on **weekdays** also signifies a strong correlation on using of Cyclistic bikes as a mode of transportation to **work**. The marketing team can tend toward promoting using Cyclistic bikes as a primary **commute transportation**.

2. Ride volume is larger on the months of **May up to September** when compared to the other months. Further data analysis should be conducted to identify **trends** on the monthly count of rides per annum to be able to make future marketing strategies based on the **monthly behavior** of users.

3. Casual rides are highly concentrated at the **center** of the town. As to convert majority of the casual riders to annual members, prioritization of marketing strategies based on location should be administered on the **center** of the town.<br>
